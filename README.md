# QuranVerseSimilarity

A Python-based NLP tool to identify conceptually similar verses in the Quran using text vectorization and cosine similarity. This project scrapes English translations of Quranic verses from [clearquran.com](https://www.clearquran.com/) and provides a user-friendly Tkinter GUI to select a verse and view the top 5 most similar verses.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically collects English translations of Quranic verses using Selenium.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Computes verse similarity using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer from scikit-learn, with cosine similarity as the metric.
- **Graphical Interface**: A Tkinter-based GUI for selecting a surah and verse, displaying the top 5 similar verses with similarity percentages.
- **Modular Design**: Separates scraping (`Quran_Scraper.ipynb`) and analysis/GUI (`Verse_Similarity_Analysis.py`) for clarity and reusability.

## Project Structure

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser and [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (matching your Chrome version)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuranVerseSimilarity.git
   cd QuranVerseSimilarity
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install ChromeDriver**:
   - Download ChromeDriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
   - Place it in your system PATH or specify its path in `Quran_Scraper.ipynb`.

## Usage
1. **Scrape Quranic verses**:
   - Open `Quran_Scraper.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Update the ChromeDriver path in the notebook if needed.
   - Run all cells to scrape verses and save them to `data/ayeh.csv`.
   - Note: This step requires an internet connection and may take time due to page loading.

2. **Run the similarity analysis and GUI**:
   - Ensure `ayeh.csv` is in the `data/` folder.
   - Run the Python script:
     ```bash
     python Verse_Similarity_Analysis.py
     ```
   - In the GUI:
     - Select a surah and verse from the dropdown menus.
     - Click "Find" to display the top 5 similar verses with their similarity scores.
     - Click "About" for project information.

## Example Output
For a selected verse (e.g., Surah Al-Fatihah, Verse 1), the GUI displays:
```
1. 2 Al-Baqarah: 92.5%
2. 3 Al-Imran: 85.3%
3. 5 Al-Ma'idah: 78.1%
4. 7 Al-A'raf: 65.4%
5. 9 At-Tawbah: 60.2%
```

## Technical Details
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium to navigate [clearquran.com](https://www.clearquran.com/) and extract verse texts.
- **NLP Pipeline**:
  - Preprocesses text by removing Arabic diacritics.
  - Vectorizes verses using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
  - Computes a weighted cosine similarity score (5:1 ratio for TF-IDF vs. CountVectorizer).
- **GUI**: Built with Tkinter, featuring comboboxes for surah/verse selection and entry widgets for results.

## Limitations
- **Data Dependency**: Requires `ayeh.csv` generated by the scraper. Future improvements could include direct data loading in the analysis script.
- **Performance**: The similarity calculation loops over all 6236 verses, which can be slow. Optimization (e.g., indexing) is recommended for large-scale use.
- **Language**: Limited to English translations. Future versions could support Arabic text with advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT).
- **GUI**: Basic design; lacks advanced features like search history or export options.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize similarity computation using vectorized operations or indexing.
- Add support for Arabic text with stemming/lemmatization.
- Enhance GUI with better styling and additional features (e.g., verse text preview).
- Replace Selenium with a lighter scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup) for efficiency.
