# 📖 Guide: Playing a Minecraft 1.19 World on Minecraft 1.21 (TLauncher)

This document explains how to move your old world (created in version 1.19) into version 1.21 and run it without issues.

## ⚡ Steps

### 1. Locate Your World Folder
- Press **Win + R** on your keyboard.  
- Type the following and press **Enter**:  
  ```
  %appdata%/.minecraft/saves
  ```
- The `saves` folder will open.  
- Each folder inside represents one Minecraft world.  

---

### 2. Make a Backup (Highly Recommended ⚠️)
- Find the folder of your world (e.g., `MyWorld`).  
- **Copy it** and place the backup somewhere safe (like your Desktop).  
  - Why? Once the world is opened in a newer version (1.21), it can’t easily be used again in an older version (1.19).  

---

### 3. Open the World in Minecraft 1.21
1. Launch **TLauncher**.  
2. Select **Minecraft 1.21** from the version list and start the game.  
3. From the main menu, go to **Singleplayer**.  
4. Your world should appear in the list.  
5. Select it and jump in! 🎮

## 🛠 Important Notes
- Minecraft worlds are usually **forward-compatible**: old worlds work in newer versions.  
- However, some things may behave differently (e.g., mob AI, block changes, or new features).  
- Always keep a **backup** of your world before upgrading.
